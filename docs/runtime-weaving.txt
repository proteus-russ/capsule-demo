If you do not have compile-time weaving enabled in your environment, you
can use run-time weaving instead.

To enable run-time weaving of aspects, include the following in the VM
arguments of your launch configs.

  -javaagent:${project_loc:proteus}/runtime-aspects/spring-instrument.jar 
  -javaagent:${project_loc:proteus}/runtime-aspects/aspectjweaver.jar
  
  
To update the jars, just select the "Gradle -> Refresh All" option on the proteus project
in eclipse or run "gradle -p proteus" on the command line.
