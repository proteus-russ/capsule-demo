This example project was tested with Intellij 15.

There are two example run configurations.
*) App with LTW. This is short for Application with Load-Time Weaving (AspectJ).
*) App with CTW. This is short for Application with Compile-Time Weaving (AspectJ).

If you are using Intellij Ultimate, you can use the example run configuration "App with CTW" to launch the app. Otherwise, use the
"App with LTW".
